Fake-news-detection-system
The spread of fake news has become a critical challenge in today's digital world. Social media platforms, online news portals, and blogs contribute to the rapid circulation of misinformation, often influencing public opinion and decision-making. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, automated systems can be developed to detect and classify fake news more efficiently.
Objective and goals : The primary objective of the fake news detection is to detect which one is fake or real news article efficiently it includes:
•	To build a machine learning model that accurately classifies news articles as real or fake.
•	To preprocess news datasets and extract relevant textual features.
•	To evaluate different machine learning algorithms and select the best-performing model.
•	To improve misinformation detection accuracy using NLP techniques.
Importance and Relevance of the Project :
Fake news has become a widespread issue in the digital age, affecting politics, social stability, and public trust in the media. The rapid growth of online platforms has made it easier for misinformation to spread, influencing public perception and decision-making. Detecting fake news manually is impractical due to the vast amount of data generated daily. Therefore, developing an automated Fake News Detection System using Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) is crucial. The system helps curb the rapid dissemination of false information, minimizing its impact on society.
